**Using Linux on ChromeOS**

This is a guide (if ur new to chromeOS or if ur experienced and need reminding LOL)

- Check Your Chromebook Compatibility (link in description :D)
- Enable Linux (Crostini) by finding linux or linux (beta)
- click set up
- then press next
- enter any username (that is approprite ofc)
- and put disk size at however much ur wanting to (Min is 10GB to run. Max is 38.2GB.) 
- then press install
- Installation should take roughly 2-3 mins (depending on how much storage u want it to take up)

After installation has finished, it should automatically open up the terminal!

Enter the code..

sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade

also do apt list --upgradable - (to update/upgrade further)

This will ensure your Linux installation is up-to-date with the latest security patches and software updates.

then there you go! you are all ready to use linux!

use google help or search up Linux help if you need any more steps

(this is just a brief explanation)

if you want detailed explanation use youtube tutorials or smth

Edit: python is the easiest coding language to learn!
